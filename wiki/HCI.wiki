= Opaque Bluetooth Connection Handles =

The Bluetooth module might immediately reuse the handle of a baseband connection after it is closed. In BTnut, we mapped the handle IDs generated by the Bluetooth module to an opaque 16-bit client connection handle. By this, if a client uses the handle of a "closed" baseband connection, the BTdaemon can can easily detect the problem.
