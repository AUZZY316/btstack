#summary Thoughts on Remote Sim Access Protocol (rSAP) and the iPhone

= Introduction =

[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bluetooth_profile#SIM_Access_Profile_.28SAP.2C_SIM.2C_rSAP.29 From Wikipedia]: "The  Remote Sim Access Protocol ... allows devices such as car phones with built in GSM  transceivers to connect to a SIM card in a phone with Bluetooth, thus the car phone itself doesn't require a separate SIM card. This profile is also known as rSAP (remote-SIM-Access-Profile).."

So far, I haven't seen a specification for that but as far as I understand that summary, it allows the car mobile telephone to exchanged data with the SIM card over Bluetooth. So, there are two main component: Bluetooth communication and SIM access.

= Details =

I would expect the Bluetooth communication to be a very basic protocol. However, I don't know, how an application on the iPhone can "talk" to the "SIM-Card". There is a /dev/tty.umts, but I have no idea what to do with it.
