#summary Service Discovery Protocol for BTstack

= Introduction =

The service discovery protocol is used to learn about services provided by remote devices and is required whenever a BTstack-based app wants to implement a standard Profile like HID or RFCOMM for other devices.

= Details =
It basically consists of a simple request-response scheme with the option of segmenting a response into multiple packets. Although it could be implemented as a client-side protocol, such as the [wiki:RFCOMM] example, it would only allow to provide a single service. So, as I plan on two different apps that required SDP, I'll going to implement a crude version for shared use.

= Limitations =
Not sure yet, but it might only support SDP records up to a max size to avoid segementation

= Plan =
 * Implement minimal SDP server and activate it in BTdaemon that at least denies all SDP requests
 * Allow to register a SDP record with the SDP server over a pseudo-BTstack command
 * Have server report single record
 * Have server report list of matching records
