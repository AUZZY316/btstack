#summary How to get started with BTstack and MSP-EXP430F5438 + CC256x

= General Tools =

The MSP430 port of BTstack is developed using the Long Term Support version of of mspgcc. General information about it and installation instructions are provided on the [http://sourceforge.net/apps/mediawiki/mspgcc/index.php?title=MSPGCC_Wiki MSPGCC Wiki]

On Unix-based systems, Subversion, make, and Python are usually installed. If not, it is easy to use the system's packet manager to install them. 

On Windows, you need to install and configure them manually:
 * Subversion: http://www.sliksvn.com/en/download 
 * Optionally Tortoise SVN: This is a GUI frontend for Subversion and makes checkouts and other operations easie by integrating into the windows explorer: http://tortoisesvn.net/downloads.html 
 * GNU Make for Windows: 
   * Download from http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages/make.htm
   * Add its bin folder to the Windows Path in Environment variable. The bin folder is where make.exe resides, and it's usually located in "C:\Program Files\GnuWin32\bin". Add this path to the Path environment variable as described later.
 * Python for Windows: 
   * Download from http://www.python.org/getit/
   * Add python installation folder to the Windows Path in Environment variable. For example, for one python installation the path is "C:\Python27".&nbsp;Add this path to the Path environment variable as described later
 * mspgcc:
   * Download MSPgcc for Windows from here:http://sourceforge.net/projects/mspgcc/files/Windows/mingw32/
   * Extract to c:\mspgcc<br>Add C:\mspgcc\bin folder to the Windows Path in Environment variable. 
 * Adding paths to Windows Path variable: Go to Control Panel -&gt; System -&gt; Advanced tab -&gt; Environment Variables.<br>In the top part you will see a list of User variables.&nbsp; Click on the Path variable and then click edit. Go to the end of the line, then append "C:\mspgcc\bin" to the list without the quotes. Ensure that there is a semicolon before and after "C:\mspgcc\bin". 

= Get BTstack =

Use Subversion to get a check out of the latest version. There are two approaches:
 # Use subversion in a command line: Simply go to a folder where you would like to download BTstack, then type:
{{{svn checkout http://btstack.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/}}}
 # Windows-only: Use tortoise svn (to checkout by using the URL http://btstack.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/

In both cases, subversion will create a folder and pull all the code there.

= CC256x Init Scripts  =

In order to use the CC256x device inside of the PAN13xx modules, an initialization script must be obtained. Due to licensing restrictions, this initialization script must be obtained as follows:
 * Create a free account at myti.com
 * Download SW-DK-EM2-2560B
 * Install <br> Copy c:\Stellarware/Bluetopia/btpsvend/BTPSVEND.c into btstack/chipset-cc256x
 * Run the provided Python script: ./create_cc256x_init_scripts.py that's in chipset-cc256x
 * Add bt_control_cc256x.c plus cc2560_init_script.c or cc2567_init_script.c to your project. If you have a PAN1315, use cc2560
 * Use bt_control_cc256x_instance() to get a bt_control_t instance and use it in hci_init() call 

= Compiling the Examples  =

Open a command prompt in the MSP-EXP430F5438-CC256x/example folder and run make. If all the paths are correct, it will generate several hex files. These files are binary and can be downloaded to the MSP430 device, as per the next section.<br> 

= Downloading Binary =

To download binary files to the MSP430 MCU, you need a programming tool, the MSP430 USB&nbsp;FET debugger or other programmer connected, and the MSP430F5438 Experimenter board or other board powered to do so.
 
 * MSP430Flasher (windows-only):
   * Download the binary version of the MSP430Flasher software: http://processors.wiki.ti.com/index.php/MSP430_Flasher_-_Command_Line_Programmer<br> 
   * Use the command {{{ MSP430Flasher.exe -n MSP430F5438A -w "INSERT_NAME_OF_BINARY_OUT_FILE_HERE.hex" -v -g -z [VCC] }}}
   * Modify the name with the name of your application and execute the binary file.
