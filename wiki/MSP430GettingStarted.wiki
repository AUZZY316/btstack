#summary How to get started with BTstack and MSP-EXP430F5438 + CC256x

= General Tools =

The MSP430 port of BTstack is developed using the Long Term Support version of of mspgcc. General information about it and installation instructions are here: http://sourceforge.net/apps/mediawiki/mspgcc/index.php?title=MSPGCC_Wiki

On Unix-based systems, Subversion, make, and Python are usually installed. If not it's easy to use the system's packet manager to install them. 

On Windows, you need to install and configure them manually:
 * Subversion: http://www.sliksvn.com/en/download 
 * Optionally Tortoise SVN: This is a GUI frontend for Subversion and makes checkouts and other operations easie by integrating into the windows explorer: http://tortoisesvn.net/downloads.html 
 * GNU Make for Windows: 
   * Download from http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages/make.htm
   * Add its bin folder to the Windows Path in Environment variable. The bin folder is where make.exe resides, and it's usually located in "C:\Program Files\GnuWin32\bin". Add this path to the Path environment variable as described later.
 * Python for Windows: 
   * Download from http://www.python.org/getit/
   * Add python installation folder to the Windows Path in Environment variable. For example, for one python installation the path is "C:\Python27".&nbsp;Add this path to the Path environment variable as described later
 * mspgcc:
   * Download MSPgcc for Windows from here:http://sourceforge.net/projects/mspgcc/files/Windows/mingw32/
   * Extract to c:\mspgcc<br>Add C:\mspgcc\bin folder to the Windows Path in Environment variable. 
 * Adding paths to Windows Path variable: Go to Control Panel -&gt; System -&gt; Advanced tab -&gt; Environment Variables.<br>In the top part you will see a list of User variables.&nbsp; Click on the Path variable and then click edit. Go to the end of the line, then append "C:\mspgcc\bin" to the list without the quotes. Ensure that there is a semicolon before and after "C:\mspgcc\bin". 

= Get BTstack =

Use subversion to get a check out of the latest version. There are two approaches:
 #Use subversion in a command line: Simply go to a folder where you would like to download BTstack, then type:
{{{svn checkout http://btstack.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/}}}
 # Windows-only: Use tortoise svn (to checkout by using the URL http://btstack.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/

In both cases, subversion will create a folder and pull all the code there.
