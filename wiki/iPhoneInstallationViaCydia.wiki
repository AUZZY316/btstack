= Introduction =
*NOTE:* BTstack is tested on iPhone 3G(S) and all iPod touch models with Bluetooth. It is unclear, if it works on iPhone 2G.

Binary packages of the BTstack components and the !WiiMote demo are provided via the [BigBoss http://thebigboss.org/] repository. It can be installed by Cydia, Rock My Phone, and Icy.

== Install via Cydia ==
 * On the Cydia "Search" tab, enter _!WiiMote_ into the search field
 * Select "!WiiMote OpenGL-ES..." 
 * Select "Install" and confirm it

== Try it out ==
Press the home button, and start the new _!WiiMote_ app, ready your !WiiMote and follow the screen instruction that tells you to make it discoverable by pressing the 1+2 buttons at the same time. The current demo v1.0 only tracks rolling of the !WiiMote around the main axis.
