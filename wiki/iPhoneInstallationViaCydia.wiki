Binary packages of the BTstack components and the WiiMote demo are provided at: http://btstack.googlecode.com/svn/debs/

After adding this source to Cydia, BTstack and the demo can be installed as usual.

== Add BTstack Google Code Repository to Cydia ==
 * Start Cydia
 * Select the "Manage" tab at the bottom
 * Select "Sources"
 * Select "Edit" in the upper right
 * Select "Add" in the upper left
 * Enter _http://btstack.googlecode.com/svn/debs/_ as Cydia/APT URL
 * Press "Add Source"
 * Select "Done" in the upper right
This has to be done only once.

== Install WiiMote Demo ==
 * On the Cydia "Search" tab, enter _WiiMote_ into the search field

 * Select "Install" and confirm it

== Try it out ==
 * Press the home button, and start the new _WiiMote_ app, ready your WiiMote and follow the screen instruction that tells you to make it discoverable by pressing the 1+2 buttons at the same time. The current demo v1.0 only tracks rolling of the WiiMote around the main axis.
