Binary packages of the BTstack components and the !WiiMote demo are provided at: http://btstack.googlecode.com/svn/debs/

You can install them via Cydia in two steps:
 * Add BTstack Google Code Repository to Cydia
 * Install !WiiMote demo

== Add BTstack Google Code Repository to Cydia ==
 * Start Cydia
 * Select the "Manage" tab at the bottom
 * Select "Sources"
 * Select "Edit" in the upper right
 * Select "Add" in the upper left
 * Enter _http://btstack.googlecode.com/svn/debs/_ as Cydia/APT URL
 * Press "Add Source"
 * Select "Done" in the upper right
This has to be done only once.

== Install !WiiMote Demo ==
 * On the Cydia "Search" tab, enter _!WiiMote_ into the search field
 * Select "WiiMote OopenGL-ES..." 
 * Select "Install" and confirm it

== Try it out ==
 * Press the home button, and start the new _!WiiMote_ app, ready your !WiiMote and follow the screen instruction that tells you to make it discoverable by pressing the 1+2 buttons at the same time. The current demo v1.0 only tracks rolling of the !WiiMote around the main axis.
