#summary How BTstack Keyboard hides the screen keyboard, which apps support it and what you have to change if your app doesn't.

= Introduction =
The latest version of BTstack Keyboard allows to hide the soft keyboard from an external Bluetooth keyboard with the CTRL-TAB shortcut. This is done with very little code:

{{{
void UIKeyboardOrderInAutomatic();
void UIKeyboardOrderOutAutomatic();
BOOL UIKeyboardAutomaticIsOnScreen();

static void toggleKeyboard(UIKeyboardImpl * keyImpl){
	if (UIKeyboardAutomaticIsOnScreen()) {
		UIKeyboardOrderOutAutomatic();
	} else {
		UIKeyboardOrderInAutomatic();
	}
}
}}}

This motivates the OS to hide/show the keyboard, and applications that follow [http://developer.apple.com/iPhone/library/documentation/iPhone/Conceptual/iPhoneOSProgrammingGuide/TextandWeb/TextandWeb.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40007072-CH20-SW16 Apple's SDK guidelines for Receiving Keyboard Notifications]. The most obvious mistake is to react on the - (void)textFieldDidBeginEditing:textField delegate method instead of observing UIKeyboardDidShowNotification.
