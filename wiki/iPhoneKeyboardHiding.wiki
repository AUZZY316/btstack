#summary How BTstack Keyboard hides the screen keyboard, which apps support it and what you have to change if your app doesn't.

= Introduction =
The latest version of BTstack Keyboard allows to hide the soft keyboard from an external Bluetooth keyboard with the CTRL-TAB shortcut. This is done with very little code:

{{{
void UIKeyboardOrderInAutomatic();
void UIKeyboardOrderOutAutomatic();
BOOL UIKeyboardAutomaticIsOnScreen();

static void toggleKeyboard(UIKeyboardImpl * keyImpl){
	if (UIKeyboardAutomaticIsOnScreen()) {
		UIKeyboardOrderOutAutomatic();
	} else {
		UIKeyboardOrderInAutomatic();
	}
}
}}}

This motivates the OS to hide/show the keyboard, and applications that follow [http://developer.apple.com/iPhone/library/documentation/iPhone/Conceptual/iPhoneOSProgrammingGuide/TextandWeb/TextandWeb.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40007072-CH20-SW16 Apple's SDK guidelines for receiving Keyboard Notifications] adapt their view accordingly. The most obvious mistake is to react on the - (void)textFieldDidBeginEditing:textField delegate method instead of observing UIKeyboardDidShowNotification.

*If there is an app button to show/hide the keyboard it most likely also starts/stops editing. I therefore would only expect manual activate and CTRL-TAB hide to work properly.*

= Good =
Applications that work correctly after hiding the keyboard, i.e., you can use the full screen for your text. Note: these are unverified user reports
 * Apple Notes
 * Docs To Go
 * eBuddy+
 * IM+

 * !MobileNoter (an app that syncs with Microsoft Onenote)
 * Nimbuzz
 * Notespark

= OK =
 * Mobile Terminal: it shows its own keyboard. Just double tab the screen and it is gone

= Bad  =
Applications that don't work correctly, which means that you cannot use the area below the soft keyboard after it is hidden, because of the reasons detailed above.
 * Apple Mail
 * Apple Messages (keyboard does not hide)
 * Apple Safari (keyboard does not hide)
