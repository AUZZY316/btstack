#summary Information on Bluetooth Modules based on TI's CC256x chipsets

= Introduction =
Although CC256x-based Bluetooth Modules provide the standard H4 interface, they cannot be used without an extended init script (also called "Service Pack") by Texas Instruments.

Since Dec 2011, TI releases the Service Packs for most chipsets in the BTS binary format on their wiki: http://processors.wiki.ti.com/index.php/CC256x_Downloads

= How to use CC256x chipset with BTstack =
  # Get the necessary init script from http://processors.wiki.ti.com/index.php/CC256x_Downloads
  # Unzip the zip archive, read the license file, and copy the bts file into btstack/chipset-cc256x
  # Run the provided Python script: ./convert_bts_init_scripts.py
