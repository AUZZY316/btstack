#summary Describes the overall architecture and how clients interact with the stack.

= Introduction =

The *BT Stack* has to support multiple clients. This is because the *Host Controller Interface* supported by all Bluetooth devices assumes that a single Bluetooth Stack is in control. 

== HCI Daemon ==
A minimal *HCI daemon* is necessary to handle the multiplexing of multiple applications. Applications shall communicate with the HCI daemon over Unix sockets. If possible, we want to save resources by running the HCI daemon in a single thread. An introduction on single thread unix socket servers: http://www.lowtek.com/sockets/select.html

== Current architecture ==
Application -> BT library -> Unix Socket -> HCI daemon -> HCI transport support (H4, H5, USB) -> Bluetooth module.

== Development/Debugging ==
*HCI daemon* will be able to write hci dumps in the bluez-hcidump format which can be read by the hcidump tool, the GNOME Bluetooth-Analyzer, and Wireshark. Wireshark is available on all platforms. Optionally, Apple's Packet Logger format can be supported for easier debugging on OS X.

libUSB allows to use USB BT modules during development. The newer libusb-1.0 supports asynchronous operations by way of exposing an internal file descriptor. This fits the single thread unix socket server.
 
However, it is not ported to Mac or Windows yet. As USB on non-linux systems will be only relevant for debugging, a separate thread can use the older libUSB-1.0 and signal the main loop when data is ready from USB.

== Future design decisions ==
How much state is kept in HCI daemon, how much in the Bluetooth library? A minimal HCI daemon needs to keep state that is shared between all clients. It also has to manage the single Bluetooth resource, e.g., Bluetooth should stay on as long as at least on client is connected.


== Shared state in HCI daemon ==
  * List of Baseband connections, their state sniffing/hold/park..
  * Bluetooth state: off/initializing/on/terminating
  * Configuration: page scan timeout, discoverable, etc..

== BT HCI Transport API ==
The HCI Transport API allows the HCI daemon to use different transport implementations.
 
{{{
typedef struct {
    int    (*open)(void *transport_config);
    int    (*close)();
    int    (*send_cmd_packet)(void *packet, int size);
    int    (*send_acl_packet)(void *packet, int size);
    void   (*register_event_packet_handler)(void (*handler)(void *packet, int size));
    void   (*register_acl_packet_handler)  (void (*handler)(void *packet, int size));
    int    (*get_fd)();      // <-- only used for select(..) call
    int    (*handle_data)(); // -- to be called when select( .. ) returns for the fd
    const char * (*get_transport_name)();
} hci_transport_t;
}}}

== BT Control API ==
In addition to the pure HCI implementation, there is a need for functions such as turning on/off the Bluetooth module, configuring a particular transport protocol including the physical connection (H4/H5/USB, device path, baud rate, flow control, Vendor ID, Product ID). This will be device specific, e.g., turning on Bluetooth on the iPhone requires to make use of Apple's BlueTool, on the BTnode, the power is controlled by a special kernel function.
 
== Modular Design ==
The HCI daemon is started with a pointer to an hci_transport_t structure, a pointer to an hci transport configuration structure and a pointer to an bt_control_t structure.
