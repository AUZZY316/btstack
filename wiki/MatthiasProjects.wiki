#summary List of BTstack-Related Projects of Me

= Introduction =
Thanks for all the interesting project proposals from all of you. I'm working full time in a start-up company and BTstack is "just" my main hobby project

= Tasks/Projects =
 * [http://www.tuaw.com/2010/06/28/found-footage-synergy-on-ios/ iOS client for Synergy protocol] - not Bluetooth related, but a nice little project.
   * ~~iSynergyClient 0.8~~ submitted to BigBoss repo 4th of July
   * iSynergyClient 1.0 with keyboard support based on BTstack Keyboard
 * L2CAP
   * ~~keep track of remote incoming MTU~~ r750
   * ~~use 1021 byte L2CAP buffer (3-DH5) in BTdaemon~~
   * keep track of available Baseband packet sizes for a given connection
   * fragment L2CAP packets according to available Baseband packets
 * Full RFCOMM support:
   * move RFCOMM into BTdaemon
   * use new L2CAP Credit-based Flowcontrol
   * handle multiple connections
   * handle incoming connections
 * Full OBEX support for iOS - in collaboration with  [http://code.google.com/u/francisois/ francis]
   * depends on full RFCOMM support
 * BTstack GPS Server: provide iPhone or iPad 3G GPS data to BTstack GPS
   * depends on full RFCOMM support
 * BTstack Keyboard 1.1 update: lots of details to take care of like better iPad support, accented chars, accept incoming connections, disable auto-correction, more layouts, layout switcher, alternate selection for Asian languages, support Freedom Universal SPP keyboard
 * iPhone as Keyboard & Touchpad for other devices like PC, PS3, ...
 * BTstack port for EmbeddedSystems
 * Improve use of remote desktop apps on iPad
 * Take over MouseSupport from ashikase and improve it:
   * update to use (copy of) kennytm's headers (support OS >= 3.0) 
   * add hi-res mouse pointer for iPhone 4 Retina display
   * require heartbeat from apps (Veency, BTstack Mouse, SynergyClient) to turn off when app/extension crashes
 * iPhone/iPad GameController: Play games with Wiimote, Zeemote, and PS3 SixAxis. In collaboration with conradev. 
 * Other private/consulting projects

= Other Projects... =
... I don't seem to tackle soon, feel free to contact me if you work on them :)
 * Add support for the Wii Balance board:
   * enable data reporting according to [http://wiibrew.org/wiki/Wiimote/Extension_Controllers#Balance_Board wiibrew.org documentation]
   * create 3D model of the balance board for OpenGL display
 * Audio stuff A2DP, HFP...
 * Other Bluetooth profiles

= Completed =

 * ~~BTstack on iPhone OS 4.0~~
   * ~~Is working but not released yet.~~ Release revision 757 June 22n 
   * ~~Caveat: there is no BTstack icon in the status bar~~ Solved by [http://apt.thebigboss.org/onepackage.php?bundleid=libstatusbar&db= libstatusbar] July 4rd
 * L2CAP Credit-based Flowcontrol
   * ~~query BT module for nr and size of ACL packets (HCI read buffer size command)~~ r818

     * ~~add list of parked connections~~
     * ~~if dispatch fails: remove from run loop and add to parked list~~
   * ~~have send_l2cap and send_acl return error -1 if no space on BT module~~
   * ~~implement "call re-dispatch on all parked connections, in FIFO order"~~
     * ~~if re-dispatch succeeds: remove from parked list and add to run loop~~
   * ~~provide credit-based flow control ("probably ready for x data packets")~~
     * ~~on number completed packets:~~
       * ~~call re-dispatch on parked connections~~
       * ~~hand out credits if conditions are met~~
