#summary List of BTstack-Related Projects of Me

= Introduction =
Thanks for all the interesting project proposals from all of you. I'm working full time in a start-up company and BTstack is "just" my main hobby project

= Tasks/Projects =
 * ~~Handle multiple L2CAP commands in a single signaling packet~~ fixed in revision 658
 * [SDP Service Discovery Protocol]
   * almost done
   * required by two other projects:
     * iPhone as Keyboard & Touchpad for other devices like PC, PS3, ...
     * BTstack GPS Server: provide iPhone or iPad 3G GPS data to BTstack GPS
 * BTstack on iPhone OS 4.0
   * Is working but not released yet. One caveat: there is no BTstack icon in the status bar (nobody knows how this is done by Apple and/or how to show own icons)
 * BTstack Keyboard 1.1 update: lots of details to take care of like better iPad support, accented chars, accept incoming connections, disable auto-correction, more layouts, layout switcher, alternate selection for Asian languages, support Freedom Universal SPP keyboard, more layouts
 * BTstack port for EmbeddedSystems
 * Improve use of remote desktop apps on iPad
 * Other private/consulting projects
