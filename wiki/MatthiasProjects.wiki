 * [SDP Service Discovery Protocol]
   * almost done
   * required by two other projects:
     * iPhone as Keyboard & Touchpad for other devices like PC, PS3, ...
     * BTstack GPS Server: provide iPhone or iPad 3G GPS data to BTstack GPS
 * BTstack on iPhone OS 4.0
   * Is working but not released yet. One caveat: there is no BTstack icon in the status bar (nobody knows how this is done by Apple and/or how to show own icons)
