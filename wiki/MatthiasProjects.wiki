= Introduction =
Thanks for all the interesting project proposals from all of you. I'm working full time in a start-up company and BTstack is "just" my main hobby project

   * provide information if BTstack GPS is active
   * add option to throttle update rate
   * add option to enforce pairing
   * use speed & course from NMEA messages
   * use accuracy from NMEA messages
   * use new RFCOMM API
   * Server option: provide iPhone or iPad 3G GPS data to BTstack GPS
 * hid-support:
   * Add mouse pointer simulation. send touch event for mouse pointer point 
   * add hi-res mouse pointer for iPhone 4 Retina display
   * require heartbeat from apps (Veency, BTstack Mouse, SynergyClient) to turn off when app/extension crashes
 * BTstack Keyboard 1.1 update, lots of details to take care of like
  * split into background daemon + config app/preference bundle
  * auto-accept incoming connections

... I don't seem to tackle soon, feel free to contact me if you work on them :)
 * Add support for the Wii Balance board:
   * enable data reporting according to [http://wiibrew.org/wiki/Wiimote/Extension_Controllers#Balance_Board wiibrew.org documentation]
   * create 3D model of the balance board for OpenGL display
 * Audio stuff A2DP, HFP...
 * Other Bluetooth profiles
 * [http://www.tuaw.com/2010/06/28/found-footage-synergy-on-ios/ iOS client for Synergy protocol] - not Bluetooth related, but a nice little project.
   * ~~iSynergyClient 0.8~~ submitted to BigBoss repo 4th of July
   * released as open source project at http://code.google.com/p/isynergyclient/

   * ~~have send_l2cap and send_acl return error -1 if no space on BT module~~
   * ~~implement "call re-dispatch on all parked connections, in FIFO order"~~
     * ~~if re-dispatch succeeds: remove from parked list and add to run loop~~
   * ~~provide credit-based flow control ("probably ready for x data packets")~~
