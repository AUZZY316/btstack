#summary Ideas and Notes on a Port of BTstack for use on Embedded Systems.

= Introduction =
While BTstack runs on most OSs with POSIX file I/O, it cannot run on Embedded Systems that luck such luxury. When running on a device without any OS some things have to change. Examples for such a system might be the Arduino platform, if a bigger MCU like the ATmega 2561 is used, or the [http://btnode.ethz.ch BTnode], or, your favorite ARM-developer board. :)

= Details =
On top of my head, the following files are needed:
 * run_loop_embedded.c
 * h4_embedded.c
 * bt_control_embedded.c
 * socket_connection_embedded.c
 * daemon_embedded.c
