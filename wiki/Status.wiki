BTstack reached version 0.1 and allows for multiple outgoing L2CAP connections and rudimentary RFCOMM connections. Although in an early stage, it supports Bluetooth Human Interface Devices via L2CAP (keyboard, WiiMote, etc.. ), the control of robots, and basic RFCOMM-based devices like GPS receivers, the ZeeMote JS-1 joystick, or a Bluetooth Chipcard reader.

It runs in a single thread in user-space and makes use of the standard POSIX API. It expects a Bluetooth module connected via a serial connection (Bluetooth H4 HCI Transport). Support for Bluetooth USB modules is not working yet.

In particular, it runs on the iPhone 3G(S) and all iPod touch devices with Bluetooth support. It is unclear yet, if it works properly on the iPhone 2G. On this platform, BTstack is automatically started by the system's launch daemon and provides its own status bar icon to distinguish itself from Apple's Bluetooth stack. It is available as binary via the [http://www.saurik.com/id/1 Cydia distribution system].


= Bluetooth Layers =

== HCI ==
 * A minimal HCI layer is implemented. Instead of implementing each HCI command separately, a table-driven approach allows to add HCI commands by only specifying the command packet format.
 * HCI Transport:
   * H4: The original H4 protocol for UARTs is fully implemented and working.
   * BCSP/H5: The more advanced CSR BSCP and the "Three Wire UART" transport protocol are not supported.
   * USB: Some code exists, but not working yet.

== L2CAP ==
 * The L2CAP State Machine can open an HCI connection and set up an outgoing L2CAP channel. More work has to done: incoming connections, MTU negotiation, packet segmentation, packet reassembly and flow control are not implemented. 

== RFCOMM ==
 * Quite some interest, development has started. See [RFCOMM]. The existing L2CAP implementation is sufficient.

= Other =

== iPhone and iPod touch ==
 * The iPhone control component is able to switch the Bluetooth chipset on/off and properly initialize them in HCI H4 Transport mode with baud rates from 57600-921600 on all iPhone and iPod touch devices with build-in Bluetooth. Higher rates cannot be specified yet, especially not the 2.4 Mbps used by Apple. The problem is not with the Bluetooth chipset. The termios call to set the speed of the serial port returns "invalid parameter" for higher baud rates.
 * The SpringBoardAccess MobileSubstrate extension allows the BTdaemon to show a BTstack icon similar to Apple's Bluetooth icon in the status bar.
 * BTdaemon is automatically started by Launchd. This makes it more robust and allows for automatic power-off, when no application is using Bluetooth.
 * Successfully tested on iPhone 3G with OS 2.2.1 and 3.0, iPod touch 2G with 2.2.1 and 3.0, iPod touch 3G with 3.1.2, and iPhone 3GS with 3.0.1. and 3.1.2.

== Logging/Debugging ==
 * hci_dump.c supports multiple formats:
    * Apple's PacketLogger
    * Linux BlueZ format
    * Direct packet hexdump to stdout.

== Integration with existing Run Loop ==
The BTstack and its client library can work with different run loops. BTdaemon uses its own basic select()-based run loop that supports POSIX file descriptors and timers.The client library can used with the POSIX run loop as well as with a Cocoa CFRunLoop wrapper inside of an Cocao(Touch) UI application.
