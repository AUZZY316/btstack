#summary Status of the BTstack implementation

The BTstack is in early development phase and mostly suited for people interesting in learning their way around in the Bluetooth Stack. However, the example main.c can create an authenticated L2CAP connection and receive data packets.

= Bluetooth Layers =

== HCI Transport ==

=== H4 ===
 * The original H4 protocol for UARTs is fully implemented and working.
=== BCSP/H5 ===
 * The more advanced CSR BSCP and the "Three Wire UART" transport protocol are not supported.

== HCI ==
 * A minimal HCI layer is implemented. Instead of implementing each HCI command separately, a table-driven approach allows to add HCI commands by only specifying the command packet format.

== L2CAP ==
 * The L2CAP State Machine can open an HCI connection and set up an outgoing L2CAP channel. More work has to done: incoming connections, MTU negotiation, packet segmentation, packet reassembly and flow control are not implemented. 

== RFCOMM ==
 * Not started. L2CAP supports enough to allow implementation of the RFCOMM protocol.

= Other =

== BT Control ==
=== iPhone and iPod touch ===
 * The iPhone control component is able to switch the Bluetooth chipset on/off and properly initialize in to HCI H4 Transport mode with configurable baud rates from 57600-921600.
 * Higher rates cannot be specified yet, especially not the 2.4 Mbps used by Apple. The problem is not with the Bluetooth chipset. The ioctl call to set the speed of the serial port just returns "invalid parameter" for higher baud rates.
 * Repeated power on/off work without issues, so the BTdaemon can keep running with the BT turned off completely while the iPhone is in sleep mode.
 * Successfully tested on iPhone 3G with OS 2.2.1 and 3.0

== Logging/Debugging ==
 * hci_dump.c supports multiple formats:
    * Apple's PacketLogger
    * Linux BlueZ format
    * Direct packet hexdump to stdout.

== Run Loop ==
A basic run loop handler allows to add multiple data sources that are represented as POSIX file descriptors. The H4 HCI transport is run loop compatible. A TCP socket server is available.
